# Network stress tester (Denial Of Service)

## Usage:

```
python dos.py <destination> <# of threads> [options]
```

#### Options:

* `-v` verbose output

* `-p`: use python's built in request module instead of `curl`.
This is much slower and more error prone. Only use this option if you do not have `curl`.
